The term <br>"RAG"<\br> in the context you described indeed stands for "Retrieval Augmented Generation."

This concept is a method of enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or GPT-4 by incorporating a database of document embeddings.

<br>Here's a breakdown of how it works:<\br> Database of Document Embeddings: A vector database is created, containing embeddings of various documents. These document embeddings are typically representations of the documents in a high-dimensional vector space, generated using techniques like Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, or more advanced methods like BERT embeddings.

<br>Querying the Database:<\br> When a user provides a query or prompt to the LLM, instead of relying solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge, the system also queries this database of document embeddings. The query is used to find semantically similar documents within the database.

<br>Retrieval of Relevant Content:<\br> The documents retrieved from the database are considered semantically similar to the user's query. This retrieval process can be based on cosine similarity or other vector-based distance metrics. The retrieved documents are then used as additional context or information for the LLM.

<br>Model Augmentation:<\br> The retrieved content from the database is fed to the LLM along with the user's query. This additional information acts as context or input for the model. The LLM can now generate responses that are more informed and contextually relevant based on both its pre-trained knowledge and the retrieved documents.

<br>Enhanced Output:<\br> The output generated by the LLM is enhanced with the extra information from the retrieved documents, potentially making the responses more accurate, informative, and contextually appropriate. RAG models are particularly useful in situations where it's important to provide responses that are not solely reliant on the pre-existing knowledge of the LLM but also on specific, up-to-date, or contextually relevant information present in a document database. This approach can be valuable for tasks like question-answering, content generation, or dialogue systems when a broader context is needed.
